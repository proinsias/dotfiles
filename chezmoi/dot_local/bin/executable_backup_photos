#                            iCloud Photos Backup Script
#
# ==============================================================================
#
# Purpose:
#   This script automates the process of backing up iCloud Photos for multiple
#   users to a designated external hard drive. It uses 'icloudpd' to download
#   photos and videos from specified iCloud accounts and libraries.
#
# Dependencies:
#   - icloudpd: A command-line tool to download iCloud photos.
#     (https://github.com/icloud-photos-downloader/icloud_photos_downloader)
#   - bash: The script is written for the bash shell.
#   - macOS Keychain: The script is configured to use 'keyring' to securely
#     fetch iCloud passwords, which typically integrates with the macOS Keychain.
#
# Pre-run Configuration:
#   1. Ensure 'icloudpd' is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
#   2. The target backup volume, "/Volumes/My Passport/", must be mounted and
#      writable.
#   3. For non-interactive execution, ensure the iCloud account passwords are
#      stored in your system's keychain so 'icloudpd' can retrieve them via
#      the 'keyring' password provider. If not found, 'icloudpd' will fall
#      back to prompting for the password on the console.
#
# Usage:
#   Execute the script from your terminal:
#   backup_photos
#
# Script Breakdown:
#   The script executes a series of 'icloudpd' commands, one for each user
#   or library to be backed up.
#
#   - For 'francis.odonovan+apple@gmail.com', it backs up both the personal
#     "PrimarySync" library and a specific "SharedSync" library.
#   - For other users ('clslesnick@gmail.com', 'bea.odonovan@icloud.com',
#     'arthur.odonovan@icloud.com'), it backs up their primary photo libraries.
#
# Email Notifications (for 2FA Expiration):
#   The script is configured to send email notifications if an account's
#   two-factor authentication session expires.
#
# TODO:
#   - Setup email notifications for expired two-factor authentication sessions - see below.
#   - Set up this script to run automatically on a schedule using a cron job with pushover.net notifications.

# FIXME:
#   Setup for Gmail:
#   1. Generate an "App Password" from your Google Account security settings.
#   2. Store this password securely in the macOS Keychain:
#      security add-generic-password -a "$USER" -s "icloudpd-smtp-gmail" -w "YOUR_APP_PASSWORD"
#   3. Add the following flags to the desired 'icloudpd' command, after
#      retrieving the password in the script:
#      --smtp-host "smtp.gmail.com" \
#      --smtp-port 587 \
#      --smtp-username "your-email@gmail.com" \
#      --smtp-password "$YOUR_RETRIEVED_PASSWORD" \
#      --notification-email "your-email@gmail.com"
# FIXME: Add notifications:
# You can receive an email notification when two-factor authentication expires
# by passing the --smtp-username and --smtp-password options.
# Emails will be sent to --smtp-username by default,
# or you can send to a different email address with --notification-email.
#
# # Retrieve the stored SMTP password from the keychain
# SMTP_PASSWORD=$(security find-generic-password -w -s "icloudpd-smtp-gmail")
# SMTP_USERNAME="francis.odonovan+apple@gmail.com"
#
# icloudpd \
#     --password-provider keyring \
#     --password-provider console \
#     --username "${SMTP_USERNAME}" \
#     --directory "/Volumes/My Passport/Backups/Photos/Francis" \
#     --library "PrimarySync" \
#     --smtp-host "smtp.gmail.com" \
#     --smtp-port 587 \
#     --smtp-username "${SMTP_USERNAME}" \
#     --smtp-password "${SMTP_PASSWORD}" \
#     --notification-email "${SMTP_USERNAME}"#

# Use the curl command in a launchd plist file to ping Healthchecks.io's /start and /success URLs.
# For example, in your launchd job, add a ProgramArguments entry that calls:
# curl -fsS https://hc-ping.com/YOUR-UUID/start
# # Your task logic here
# curl -fsS https://hc-ping.com/YOUR-UUID/success
#
# Use /fail if the task fails.
# This approach allows you to track the start, completion, and duration of launchd jobs, just like cron jobs.

#
#                    Scheduling with launchd and Lingon X
#
# ==============================================================================
#
# While cron is a traditional way to schedule tasks, on macOS, launchd is the
# modern and recommended method. It is more robust and offers better
# integration with the operating system.
#
# 'Lingon X' is a powerful graphical application that makes it easy to create
# and manage launchd jobs without manually writing XML .plist files.
#
# --- Guide to Scheduling with Lingon X ---
#
# 1.  **Create a New Job:**
#     - Open Lingon X and click the '+' button to create a new job.
#     - Choose to create a "User Agent". This ensures the job runs when you are
#       logged in and has access to your user keychain.
#
# 2.  **Name the Job:**
#     - Use a descriptive, reverse-domain name, e.g., `com.yourname.backup-icloud-photos`.
#
# 3.  **Define the Command:**
#     - In the "What" section, enter the absolute path to this script.
#       After being applied by chezmoi, this is likely in `~/.local/bin/`.
#       Example: `/Users/your-username/.local/bin/backup_photos`
#     - **Important:** `launchd` requires absolute paths.
#
# 4.  **Set the Schedule:**
#     - In the "When" section, check "Run on a schedule".
#     - Set a calendar interval. For example, to run every day at 2:00 AM, you
#       would set the interval for every 1 day, at Hour 2, Minute 0.
#
# 5.  **Log Script Output (Recommended):**
#     - It's crucial to log the script's output to debug any issues.
#     - In the "Advanced" section of Lingon X, you can set paths for
#       "Standard Out Log" and "Standard Error Log".
#     - Example: `~/Library/Logs/icloud_backup.log` for both.
#
# 6.  **Save and Enable:**
#     - Click "Save" in Lingon X. The job will be enabled and will run on the
#       schedule you defined.
#
# --- Important Considerations ---
#
# - **Environment Variables:** `launchd` jobs run with a minimal environment. If
#   this script depends on a specific `PATH` to find `icloudpd` or other tools,
#   you may need to set the `PATH` explicitly at the top of this script, e.g.,
#   `export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"`.
#
# - **Keychain Access:** The first time `launchd` runs this script, macOS may
#   display a security prompt asking for permission to allow the script to access
#   passwords in your keychain. You must select "Always Allow" for future runs
#   to be non-interactive.
#
# - **External Drive:** This script will only succeed if the external drive
#   ("/Volumes/My Passport") is mounted when the job runs.
